# DataSlate: A Web-Based Tabletop Game List Builder

Welcome to **DataSlate**, a passion-driven project focused on creating a web-based list-building tool for tabletop gaming enthusiasts. Leveraging the rich BSDATA repositories in a database format, this platform aims to offer a modern, accessible substitute for beloved tools like BattleScribe.

## About Me
With 12 years of experience in IT, primarily within the MSP sector, I've had the privilege of working across various roles, including Helpdesk, Project Delivery, Management, and Consultancy. Currently, I hold a management position, where I continue to refine my skills and strategic vision.

As a lifelong tabletop gaming enthusiast, I’ve spent countless hours crafting and tweaking army lists, often relying on BattleScribe as my go-to tool. Inspired by the dedication of the community and the ongoing efforts to maintain BSDATA repositories, I decided to channel my passion and expertise into developing a web-based application for fellow hobbyists.

## Current Progress
- **Database Integration**: Completed conversion of the XML structure and wahapedia into JSON, Applied into a Database with multiple collections and tested querying.
- **Backend Development**: Currently focused on creating the core "Army Builder" backend. Key features under development include:
  - Querying and validating list entries.
  - Enforcing constraints, such as point limits and unit caps.
  - Flagging rule violations (e.g., exceeding points or unit restrictions).

## Vision and Future Features

### 1. User Profiles
- Enable users to create profiles, save their lists, and track their progress.  
- Include a leaderboard showcasing player stats and achievements.

### 2. Battle Sheets
- Introduce a tool to track game scores in real-time.  
- Allow users to link scorecards, submit results, and reflect game outcomes on their profiles (e.g., win/loss ratios).

### 3. Local Game Store (LGS) Support
- Provide features for LGSs to manage their communities, track frequent players, and host localized leaderboards.

### 4. Tournament Planner
- Offer tournament management tools for LGSs, supporting events from casual meetups to larger inter-store competitions.  
- Introduce an overarching leaderboard for tournament rankings.

### 5. Achievements System
- Add gamified elements, rewarding users for milestones like building their first list, playing their first game, or winning their first tournament.

## Why DataSlate?
This project is about more than just building a tool—it's about fostering a vibrant, connected community. With the dedication of the BSDATA contributors as a foundation, I aim to create something that preserves their hard work while giving players a fresh, intuitive experience.

Thank you for following along on this journey. Your feedback and support are invaluable as I continue to bring this vision to life!
